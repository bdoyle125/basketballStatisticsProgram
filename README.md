# basketballStatisticsProgram

This program allows the user to enter their favorite basketball players, as well as their statistics in a particular season and can list this information by player name. 

For some reason, the input validation works on the NetBeans IDE, but not for Visual Studio Code.

Right now, I'm working on being able to edit the information already on the text file.
