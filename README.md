# basketballStatisticsProgram

This program allows the user to enter their favorite basketball players, as well as their statistics in a particular season and can list this information by player name. 

Right now, I'm working on establishing a way to create a text file to store this information on. Also on the agenda is reading said file and being able to edit the information already on the text file.

The printPlayerStats method is not working as intended.
